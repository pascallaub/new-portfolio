      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        Hi, I'm an all-round tech enthusiast with a passion for everything to do
        with computers, programming and innovation.
        <br /> I've been passionate about technology since I was young.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        It's not just the digital world that fascinates me: I love sport,
        whether it's weight training or a proper endurance session, <br /> and I
        like to clear my head by playing the piano or gaming.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-xl">
        My mission? To keep learning, take my skills to the next level and
        create innovative solutions that inspire people.
        <br /> Let's build something awesome!
